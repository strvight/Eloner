# Eloner
Project for RHS Programming Club's Hackathon that utilizes the Twitter API and Flask.

## What it does
Eloner looks through the past 2000 tweets (including replies) of Elon Musk to see if he has tweeted about either Bitcon or Dogecoin. If he has, the page will display the amount of tweets about the coin and the tweet itself. 

## Why I made it
As we know, when Elon Musk tweets about these coins, they often go up in value. As our theme was money, I decided to make this program which allows to always be updated when Elon tweets specifcally about these coins. 

## How to use it
Sorry, but downloading and running the code from this repository won't work because I removed the my API token. If you have your own Twitter API token, please add it to the headers dictionary in tweets.py and run app.py to use this amazing program on your own computer!
